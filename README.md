## üöÄ Installation

The easiest way to get started is by downloading the latest `AppImage` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/noyzen/distrobear/releases) page.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern Linux distribution.
-   `podman` is the recommended container runtime. The setup wizard can help install it.
-   `systemd` is required for the container autostart feature.

### Running the AppImage

1.  Make the AppImage executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x DistroBear-*.AppImage
    ```

2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    ./DistroBear-*.AppImage
    ```

On the first launch, DistroBear will check for `distrobox` and `podman`. If they are not found, a setup wizard will guide you through the installation process.
